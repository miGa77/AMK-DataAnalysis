###Handwritten Mathematical Expressions Recognition
___
The handwritten mathematical expressions recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten mathematical functions. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten mathematical expressions recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image. Therefore, we using the "CROHME: Competition on Recognition of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expressions" dataset : http://www.iapr-tc11.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=CROHME:_Competition_on_Recognition_of_Online_Handwritten_Mathematical_Expressions
